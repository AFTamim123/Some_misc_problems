Intuition:
	Taking only the positive suffix sum will work

proof: for {2 9 -5 -3}
	if we take one element per subarray then :
	1*2+2*(9)+3*(-5)+4*(-3)

So it wont give the maximum answer as we are multiplying the
negative numbers many times. So we can add them to the positive numbers.
Like {9,-5,-3}. So the subarray sum wont be negative. And adding it will
not cause the ans to decrease.

Taking suffix sum will work because if we take suffix sum till 2 (index 0).
It will also add the previous subarray {9,-5,-3}
Automatically adding the previous subarray its equal to multiplying it 
with its order number.
Like {2+{9,-5,-3}} + {9,-5,-3}
here {9,-5,-3} is the second subarray and its contributing to the answer two times

Edge case: the 0th suffix sum will always contribute to the ans as we
			cant erase element from the array
